## Translations

I'm more than happy to accept translations of my blogposts to other languages, however, I will not host them here.
Once you have an up and running translation, just open a pull request to add the link, or let me know, and I'll link to it.

[Here](https://github.com/TkDodo/blog/blob/dcde80a2fce8b38c352db045f49c608abff50daa/content/posts/practical-tanstack-query/index.mdx?plain=1#L37-L52) is an example of a translated post that could help to get you started.

The only requirement is that at the beginning of your translation, you explain
that it is a translation of the original post and link back to the original
post.

If you notice an error in an existing translation or if the link to the
translation is not working, please try to reach out to the translator directly
to get it fixed. The only thing I can do in this repo is remove the link. If
you feel that's necessary, feel free to open a pull request to do that.

Thanks for helping to make my content more accessible!
