# Hi, I'm Dominik from Vienna

I'm a web developer and open source maintainer who focuses on React and TypeScript.
I maintain [TanStack Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query) and [TanStack Router](https://github.com/TanStack/router).

Welcome to my personal blog, where I write about frontend engineering, architecture, and API design.
