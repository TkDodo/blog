Today's article comes in a different form: it's the slides + transcript from a talk I recently gave at a meetup in Vienna, as well as on the remote day of [React Summit](https://reactsummit.com/). You can swipe left or right or use the arrow buttons / arrow keys to switch between the slides. You can also find the recording on [the GitNation site](https://gitnation.com/contents/thinking-in-react-query). Enjoy!
