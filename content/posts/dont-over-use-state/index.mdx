`useState` is considered to be the most basic of all the hooks provided by React.
It is also the one you are most likely to use (no pun intended), alongside `useEffect`.

Yet over the last couple of months, I have seen this hook being misused a lot.
This has mostly nothing to do with the hook itself, but because state management is never easy.

This is the first part of a series I'm calling _useState pitfalls_,
where I will try to outline common scenarios with the useState hook that might better be solved differently.

## What is state?

I think it all boils down to understanding what state is.
Or more precisely, what state _isn't_.
To comprehend this, we have to look no further than
[the official react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-3-identify-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state):

> Ask three questions about each piece of data:

> Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
> Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
> Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

So far, so easy. Putting _props to state_ (1) is a whole other topic I will probably write about another time
\[edit: I did that in [part 2](putting-props-to-use-state)\],
and if you are not using the setter at all (2), then it is hopefully pretty obvious that we are _not_ dealing with state.

That leaves the third question: _derived state_.
It might seem quite apparent that a value that can be computed from a state value is _not_ its own state.
However, when I reviewed some code challenges for a client of mine lately, this is exactly the pattern I have seen a lot,
even from senior candidates.

## An example

The exercise is pretty simple and goes something like this:
Fetch some data from a remote endpoint (a list of items with categories) and let the user filter by the category.

The way the state was managed looked something like this most of the time:

```jsx:title=use-state
import { fetchData } from './api'
import { computeCategories } from './utils'

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null)
  const [categories, setCategories] = React.useState([])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function fetch() {
      const response = await fetchData()
      setData(response.data)
    }

    fetch()
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (data) {
      setCategories(computeCategories(data))
    }
  }, [data])

  return <>...</>
}
```

At first glance, this looks okay. You might be thinking:
We have an effect that fetches the data for us, and another effect that keeps the categories _in sync_ with the data.
This is exactly what the useEffect hook is for (keeping things in sync), so what is bad about this approach?

## Getting out of sync

This will actually work fine, and it's also not totally unreadable or hard to reason about.
The problem is that we have a "publicly" available function `setCategories` that future developers might use.

If we intended our categories to be solely dependent on our data (like we expressed with our useEffect), this is bad news:

```jsx:title=bad-news {2,26}
import { fetchData } from './api'
import { computeCategories, getMoreCategories } from './utils'

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null)
  const [categories, setCategories] = React.useState([])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function fetch() {
      const response = await fetchData()
      setData(response.data)
    }

    fetch()
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (data) {
      setCategories(computeCategories(data))
    }
  }, [data])

  return (
    <>
      ...
      <Button onClick={() => setCategories(getMoreCategories())}>
        Get more
      </Button>
    </>
  )
}
```

Now what? We have no predictable way of telling what "categories" are.

- The page loads, categories are _X_
- User clicks the button, categories are _Y_
- If the data fetching re-executes, say, because we are using [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/),
  which has features like automatic re-fetching when you focus your tab or when you re-connect to your network
  (it's awesome, you should give it a try), the categories will be _X_ again.

Inadvertently, we have now introduced a hard to track bug that will only occur every now and then.

## No-useless-state

Maybe this is not so much about useState after all, but more about a misconception with useEffect:
It should be used to sync your state _with something outside of React_.
Utilizing useEffect to sync _two react states_ is rarely right.

So I'd like to postulate the following:

> Whenever a state setter function is only used synchronously in an effect, get rid of the state!

<p style="padding-left: 3rem; margin-top: -1rem">— TkDodo</p>

This is loosely based on what [@sophiebits](https://bsky.app/profile/sophiebits.com) posted recently on twitter:

<Tweet
  name="ms. sophie bites"
  handle="AvatarSophiebits"
  tweetId="1293710971274289152"
  avatar={<AvatarSophiebits />}
  date={new Date('2020-08-13')}
>
  <p>
  WTB a lint rule that detects
  </p>
  <p>
  <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "const [processedData, setProcessedData] = useState();" }} />
  <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "useEffect(() => {" }} />
  <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "&nbsp;&nbsp;let processed = /* do something with data */;" }} />
  <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "&nbsp;&nbsp;setProcessedData(processed);" }} />
  <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "}, [data]);" }} />
  </p>
  <p>
and tells you to use useMemo instead.
  </p>

</Tweet>

This is solid advice, and I'd go even further and suggest that unless we have proven that the calculation is expensive,
I wouldn't even bother to memoize it. Don't prematurely optimize, always measure first.
We want to have proof that something is slow before acting on it. For more on this topic, I highly recommend
[this article by @ryanflorence](https://reacttraining.com/blog/react-inline-functions-and-performance).

In my world, the example would look just like this:

```diff:title=no-useless-state
import { fetchData } from './api'
import { computeCategories } from './utils'

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null)
-  const [categories, setCategories] = React.useState([])
+  const categories = data ? computeCategories(data) : []

  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function fetch() {
      const response = await fetchData()
        setData(response.data)
      }

      fetch()
    }, [])

-  React.useEffect(() => {
-    if (data) {
-      setCategories(computeCategories(data))
-    }
-  }, [data])

  return <>...</>
}
```

We've reduced complexity by halving the amount of effects and we can now clearly see that categories is _derived from_ data.
If the next person wants to calculate categories differently, they have to do it from _within_ the `computeCategories` function.
With that, we will always have a clear picture of what categories are and where they come from.

A single source of truth.
