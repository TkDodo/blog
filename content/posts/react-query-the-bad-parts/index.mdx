title: React Query - The Bad Parts
description: In this talk, maintainer Dominik will explore the other side—the less favorable aspects of React Query and situations where it may not be the best fit. No library is perfect; every choice involves trade-offs. By the end of this talk, you'll have a better understanding of React Query's limitations and why it remains a compelling choice despite them.
