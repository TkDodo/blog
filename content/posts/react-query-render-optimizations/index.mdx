**Disclaimer**: Render optimizations are an advanced concept for any app. TanStack Query already comes with very good optimizations and defaults out of the box, and most of the time, no further optimizations are needed. "Unneeded re-renders" is a topic that many people tend to put a lot of focus on, which is why I've decided to cover it. But I wanted to point out once again, that usually, for most apps, render optimizations probably don't matter as much as you'd think. Re-renders are a good thing. They make sure your app is up-to-date. I'd take an "unnecessary re-render" over a "missing render-that-should-have-been-there" all day every day. For more on this topic, please read:

I've already written quite a bit about render optimizations when describing the select option in [#2: TanStack Query Data Transformations](react-query-data-transformations). However, "Why does TanStack Query re-render my component two times even though nothing changed in my data" is the question I probably needed to answer the most (apart from maybe: "Where can I find the v2 docs" 😅). So let me try to explain it in-depth.

## isFetching transition

I haven't been entirely honest in the [last example](react-query-data-transformations#3-using-the-select-option) when I said that this component will only re-render if the length of todos change:

```tsx:title=count-component
export const useTodosQuery = (select) =>
  useQuery(['todos'], fetchTodos, { select })
export const useTodosCount = () => useTodosQuery((data) => data.length)

function TodosCount() {
  const todosCount = useTodosCount()

  return <div>{todosCount.data}</div>
}
```

Every time you make a background refetch, this component will re-render twice with the following query info:

```
{ status: 'success', data: 2, isFetching: true }
{ status: 'success', data: 2, isFetching: false }
```

That is because TanStack Query exposes a lot of meta information for each query, and _isFetching_ is one of them. This flag will always be true when a request is in-flight. This is quite useful if you want to display a background loading indicator. But it's also kinda unnecessary if you don't do that.

### notifyOnChangeProps

For this use-case, TanStack Query has the _notifyOnChangeProps_ option. It can be set on a per-observer level to tell TanStack Query: Please only inform this observer about changes if one of these props change. By setting this option to `['data']`, we will find the optimized version we seek:

```ts:title=optimized-with-notifyOnChangeProps
export const useTodosQuery = (select, notifyOnChangeProps) =>
  useQuery(['todos'], fetchTodos, { select, notifyOnChangeProps })
export const useTodosCount = () =>
  useTodosQuery((data) => data.length, ['data'])
```

You can see this in action in the [optimistic-updates-typescript](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query/blob/9023b0d1f01567161a8c13da5d8d551a324d6c23/examples/optimistic-updates-typescript/pages/index.tsx#L35-L48) example in the docs.

### Staying in sync

While the above code works well, it can get out of sync quite easily. What if we want to react to the _error_, too? Or we start to use the _isLoading_ flag? We have to keep the _notifyOnChangeProps_ list in sync with whichever fields we are actually using in our components. If we forget to do that, and we only observe the _data_ property, but get an _error_ that we also display, our component will not re-render and is thus outdated. This is especially troublesome if we hard-code this in our custom hook, because the hook does not know what the component will actually use:

```tsx:title=outdated-component
export const useTodosCount = () =>
  useTodosQuery((data) => data.length, ['data'])

function TodosCount() {
  // 🚨 we are using error, but we are not getting notified if error changes!
  const { error, data } = useTodosCount()

  return (
    <div>
      {error ? error : null}
      {data ? data : null}
    </div>
  )
}
```

As I have hinted in the disclaimer in the beginning, I think this is way worse than the occasional unneeded re-render. Of course, we can pass the option to the custom hook, but this still feels quite manual and boilerplate-y. Is there a way to do this automatically? Turns out, there is:

### Tracked Queries

I'm quite proud of this feature, given that it was my first major contribution to the library. If you set _notifyOnChangeProps_ to `'tracked'`, TanStack Query will keep track of the fields you are using during render, and will use this to compute the list. This will optimize exactly the same way as specifying the list manually, except that you don't have to think about it. You can also turn this on globally for all your queries:

```tsx:title=tracked-queries
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      notifyOnChangeProps: 'tracked',
    },
  },
})
function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Example />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```

With this, you never have to think about re-renders again. Of course, tracking the usages has a bit of an overhead as well, so make sure you use this wisely. There are also some limitations to tracked queries, which is why this is an opt-in feature:

- If you use [object rest destructuring](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread/blob/6ee4ce3cdda246746fc46fb149bb8b43c28e704d/Rest.md), you are effectively observing all fields. Normal destructuring is fine, just don't do this:

```ts:title=problematic-rest-destructuring
// 🚨 will track all fields
const { isLoading, ...queryInfo } = useQuery(...)

// ✅ this is totally fine
const { isLoading, data } = useQuery(...)
```

- Tracked queries only work "during render". If you only access fields during effects, they will not be tracked. This is quite the edge case though because of dependency arrays:

```ts:title=tracking-effects
const queryInfo = useQuery(...)

// 🚨 will not corectly track data
React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log(queryInfo.data)
})

// ✅ fine because the dependency array is accessed during render
React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log(queryInfo.data)
}, [queryInfo.data])
```

- Tracked queries don't reset on each render, so if you track a field once, you'll track it for the lifetime of the observer:

```ts:title=no-reset
const queryInfo = useQuery(...)

if (someCondition()) {
    // 🟡 we will track the data field if someCondition was true in any previous render cycle
    return <div>{queryInfo.data}</div>
}
```

**Update**: Starting with v4, tracked queries are turned on per default in TanStack Query, and you can opt out of the feature with _notifyOnChangeProps: 'all'_.

## Structural sharing

A different, but no less important render optimization that TanStack Query has turned on out of the box is _structural sharing_. This feature makes sure that we keep referential identity of our _data_ on every level. As an example, suppose you have the following data structure:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Learn React", "status": "active" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Learn TanStack Query", "status": "todo" }
]
```

Now suppose we transition our first todo into the _done_ state, and we make a background refetch. We'll get a completely new json from our backend:

```diff
[
-  { "id": 1, "name": "Learn React", "status": "active" },
+  { "id": 1, "name": "Learn React", "status": "done" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Learn TanStack Query", "status": "todo" }
]
```

Now TanStack Query will attempt to compare the old state and the new and keep as much of the previous state as possible. In our example, the todos array will be new, because we updated a todo. The object with id 1 will also be new, but the object for id 2 will be the same reference as the one in the previous state - TanStack Query will just copy it over to the new result because nothing has changed in it.

This comes in very handy when using selectors for partial subscriptions:

```ts:title=optimized-selectors
// ✅ will only re-render if _something_ within todo with id:2 changes
// thanks to structural sharing
const { data } = useTodo(2)
```

As I've hinted before, for selectors, structural sharing will be done twice: Once on the result returned from the _queryFn_ to determine if anything changed at all, and then once more on the _result_ of the selector function. In some instances, especially when having very large datasets, structural sharing _can_ be a bottleneck. It also only works on json-serializable data. If you don't need this optimization, you can turn it off by setting _structuralSharing: false_ on any query.

Have a look at the [replaceEqualDeep tests](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query/blob/80cecef22c3e088d6cd9f8fbc5cd9e2c0aab962f/src/core/tests/utils.test.tsx#L97-L304) if you want to learn more about what happens under the hood.
