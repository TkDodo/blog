[React.useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) is pretty straightforward to use. A value, a setter function, an initial state. What hidden gems could possibly be there to know about? Well, here are 5 things you can profit from on a daily basis that you might not have known:

## 1: The functional updater

Good old _setState_ (in React class components) had it, and _useState_ has it, too: The functional updater! Instead of passing a new value to the setter that we get from _useState_, we can also pass a function to it. React will call that function and gives us the _previousValue_, so that we can calculate a new result depending on it:

```js:title=functional-updater
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

// 🚨 depends on the current count value to calculate the next value
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>

// ✅ uses previousCount to calculate next value
<button onClick={() => setCount(previousCount => previousCount + 1)}>Increment</button>
```

This might be totally irrelevant, but it might also introduce subtle bugs in some situations:

### Calling the same setter multiple times

Live example:

<Playground template="react">

```js name=App.js active
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setCount(count + 1)
        setCount(count + 1)
      }}
    >
      🚨 This will not work, count is: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

</Playground>

Each click will only increment the count once, because both calls to _setCount_ close over the same value (_count_). It's important to know that _setCount_ will _not_ immediately set the count. The useState updater only schedules an update. It basically tells React:

> Please set this value to the new value, somewhen.

And in our example, we are telling React the same thing twice:

> Please set the count to two<br/>
> Please set the count to two

React does so, but this is probably not what we intended to say. We wanted to express:

> Please increment the current value<br/>
> Please increment the current value (again)

The functional updater form ensures this:

<Playground template="react">

```js name=App.js active
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setCount((prev) => prev + 1)
        setCount((prev) => prev + 1)
      }}
    >
      ✅ Increment by 2, count is: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

</Playground>

### When async actions are involved

Kent C. Dodds has written a lengthy post about this [here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/use-state-lazy-initialization-and-function-updates), and the conclusion is:

> Any time I need to compute new state based on previous state, I use a function update.

<p style="padding-left: 3rem; margin-top: -1rem">— Kent C. Dodds</p>

I can second that conclusion and encourage you to read that article thoroughly.

### Bonus: Avoiding dependencies

The functional updater form can also help you to avoid dependencies for _useEffect_, _useMemo_ or _useCallback_. Suppose you want to pass an increment function to a memoized child component. We can make sure the function doesn't change too often with _useCallback_, but if we close over _count_, we will still create a new reference whenever count changes. The functional updater avoids this problem altogether:

```js:title=avoiding-dependencies
function Counter({ incrementBy = 1 }) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  // 🚨 will create a new function whenever count changes because we close over it
  const increment = React.useCallback(() => setCount(count + incrementBy), [
    incrementBy,
    count,
  ])

  // ✅ avoids this problem by not using count at all
  const increment = React.useCallback(
    () => setCount((previousCount) => previousCount + incrementBy),
    [incrementBy]
  )
}
```

### Bonus2: Toggling state with useReducer

Toggling a Boolean state value is likely something that you've done once or twice before. Judging by the above rule, it becomes a bit boilerplate-y:

```js:title=🚨-toggle-with-use-state
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(true)

<button onClick={() => setValue(previousValue => !previousValue)}>Toggle</button>
```

If the only thing you want to do is toggle the state value, maybe even multiple times in one component, _useReducer_ might be the better choice, as it:

- shifts the toggling logic from the setter invocation to the hook call
- allows you to name your toggle function, as it's not just a setter
- reduces repetitive boilerplate if you use the toggle function more than once

```js:title=✅-toggle-with-use-reducer
const [value, toggleValue] = React.useReducer(previous => !previous, true)

<button onClick={toggleValue}>Toggle</button>
```

I think this shows quite well that reducers are not only good for handling "complex" state, and you don't need to dispatch events with it at all costs.

## 2: The lazy initializer

When we pass an initial value to _useState_, the initial variable is always created, but React will only use it for the first render. This is totally irrelevant for most use cases, e.g. when you pass a string as initial value. In rare cases, we have to do a complex calculation to initialize our state. For these situations, we can pass a function as initial value to _useState_. React will only invoke this function when it really needs the result (= when the component mounts):

```js:title=lazy-initializer
// 🚨 will unnecessarily be computed on every render
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(
  calculateExpensiveInitialValue(props)
)

// ✅ looks like a small difference, but the function is only called once
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(() =>
  calculateExpensiveInitialValue(props)
)
```

## 3: The update bailout

When you call the updater function, React will not always re-render your component. It will bail out of rendering if you try to update to the same value that your state is currently holding. React uses [Object.is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is#description) to determine if the values are different. See for yourself in this live example:

<Playground template="react">

```js name=App.js active
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Elias')

  // 🤯 clicking this button will
  // not re-render the component
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setName('Elias')}>
      Name is: {name}, Date is: {new Date().getTime()}
    </button>
  )
}
```

</Playground>

## 4: The convenience overload

This one is for all TypeScript users out there. Type inference for _useState_ usually works great, but if you want to initialize your value with _undefined_ or _null_, you need to explicitly specify the generic parameter, because otherwise, TypeScript will not have enough information:

```ts:title=use-state-type-inferrence
// 🚨 age will be inferred to `undefined` which is kinda useless
const [age, setAge] = React.useState(undefined)

// 🆗 but a bit lengthy
const [age, setAge] = React.useState<number | null>(null)
```

Luckily, there is a [convenience overload](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/7a0d9c019f2b48b36b88691247870e6885b97a02/types/react/v16/index.d.ts#L921-L928) of _useState_ that will add _undefined_ to our passed type if we completely omit the initial value. It will also be _undefined_ at runtime, because not passing a parameter at all is equivalent to passing _undefined_ explicitly:

```ts:title=use-state-convenience-overload
// ✅ age will be `number | undefined`
const [age, setAge] = React.useState<number>()
```

Of course, if you absolutely have to initialize with _null_, you need the lengthy version.

## 5: The implementation detail

_useState_ is (kinda) implemented with _useReducer_ under the hood. You can see this in [the source code here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1a7472624661270008011fd77f097d71e6249de9/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.new.js#L1242-L1246). There is also a great article by Kent C. Dodds on [how to implement useState with useReducer](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-implement-usestate-with-usereducer).

## Conclusion

The first 3 of those 5 things are actually mentioned directly in the Hooks API Reference of the official React docs I linked to at the very beginning 😉. If you didn't know about these things before - now you do!
