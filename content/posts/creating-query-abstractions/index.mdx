Developers love creating abstractions. We see some code that we'll need in a different place - abstraction. Need this 3-liner, but slightly different - abstraction (with a flag). Need something that every `useQuery` should do - Create an aBsTrAcTiOn!

There's nothing wrong with abstractions per se, but they have tradeoffs, like everything else. Dan's talk [The wet codebase](https://www.deconstructconf.com/2019/dan-abramov-the-wet-codebase) is among one of my favourite talks ever, and he explains this really well.
